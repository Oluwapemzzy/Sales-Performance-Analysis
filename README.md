# Sales-Performance-Analysis
Sales Performance Analysis for a Retail Store Incubator Hub Project

## FIRST STEP WORKING WITH MICROSOFT EXCEL
- I cleaned my dataset by selecting the dataset using ctrl+shift+end to select my dataset, then I clicked DATA on the toolbar then clicked on remove duplicates. This helped me removed any duplicate rows.
- I eliminated all blank spaces by selecting the dataset then click on DATA in the tool bar then I selected "Find and select", look for "special", clicked on "blanks", then the blank spaces was selected and then i deleted.
- My dataset was clean and ready and read to use
- I proceeded to do the project task where I was to summarise the total sales by products, region and month.

## Total Sales by Products
- I created a row called "Total Sales" on the SALESDATAtable using the forumlar, "Quantity * UnitPrice.
- I proceeded to creating the pivot tables where I dragged "Product" to ROW and "TotalSales" to VALUES  under the pivot table filter

## Interesting Report
- I used Delimiter function to divide the OrderDate into its components: Day, Month and Year creating individual rows
